- Improve logic so function doesn't return until app status has changed actually so there's no delay between loading button state and change in status
- Add a Loopservice icon next to the title
- If service is already running on that port clarify that message and just attach to it and start tracking
- Implement uptime
- Use Tailscale for this use case
    - Make the Port like this :8080, and make the PID and Port both monospaced like the command text
